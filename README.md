# Overview

Using Jax, demo of the adjoint optimization.
The toy case is solving a Laplace equation with a simple central difference.

- `forward.py` demos the forward solving procedure and it is used to generate the truth solution.
- `adjoint.py` demos the adjoint optimization procedure.
- `plot_T_K.ipynb` visualizes the solution T and the design variables K.
- `K_adj-N10-AbsErr15.npy` is the K distribution generated by the adjoint optimization at the no. 100 iteration with the absolute error 15. For `K_adj-N10-AbsErr300.npy`, the absolution error is 300 at the no. 10 iteration.

The auto differentiation is employed by using Jax.
